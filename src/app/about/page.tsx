                  Historically, the main area of design was regarded as only
                  architecture, which was understood as the major art. The
                  design of clothing, furniture, and other common artefacts was
                  left mostly to tradition or artisans specializing in
                  hand-making them With the increasing complexity in industrial
                  design of today's society, and due to the need for mass
                  production where more time is usually associated with more
                  cost, the production methods became more.

                  Building a professional and friendly environment is very

                  We use Sprints to quickly assess the possibility of success of
                  a product to minimize risks. It is like seeing the future
                  before we invest too much time and money in product
                  development. This tool helps define goals and validate
                  assumptions when testing the product at the end of a Sprint.
                  Each project requires a different approach, this tool is
                  versatile and can be adapted to better fit the needs of your
                  product/project.

                  The brand visuals are based on these values, professional,
                  trustworthy, modern and clean. They seemed appropriated for
                  the field of operation, and also important for the customers.
                  I opted for a minimalistic approach reducing the visual
                  content to what is important. Another element that guided my
                  decisions was the logotype it wasn't created by me and there
                  was no briefing soo I imagined which kind of brand will fit
                  that logo.
